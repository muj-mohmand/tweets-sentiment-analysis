2023-03-31 20:29:39+00:00,RedBeardBets,Last 2 times the Lakers/Wolves have matched up they’ve hit 212 and 213. This will be a playoff atmosphere game which typically leads to tighter defense. 232.5 is a very high number here imo. Sabonis just had 10 rebounds in 27 minutes. 14 is very reachable if Portland can hang in https://t.co/IOGXjPZ9bM

2023-03-31 16:14:40+00:00,drewskii21,There is no valid reason to boo DLO. He didn’t demand a trade. He originally wanted to be here. He helped us in many ways &amp; is playing well for the Lakers. Let him be. We’re happy with Conley as our PG.

2023-03-31 16:14:21+00:00,GordonnBleu,@pKsupreme @Jag91705Green @timkawakami And the warriors would still be a game and a half over the lakers if they won😂
